Special thanks to Lama Dev for their inspiring YouTube video that served as a foundation for this project. While the project started with their guidance, I've taken the initiative to improve certain features and introduce transitions and animations to elevate the overall experience.
What Next 🔮

I have exciting plans for the future of this project. I aim to expand it into a full-stack application by integrating Node.js and Express for backend functionality. This will allow for more advanced features, user authentication, and a complete end-to-end experience.
